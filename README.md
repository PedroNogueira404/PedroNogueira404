## Hi there 👋


# 👨‍🚀 Pedro Nogueira

Hi! I'm Pedro, an astrophysicist, python developer, and science communicator.

🔭 I research **planet-forming disks and exoplanets**, combining observations (mainly ALMA, and SPHERE/GEMINI) with theoretical modeling and simulation to understand planet formation and evolution.

🛠 I develop tools in **Python**, **LaTeX**, and **Bash** to automate analysis, data visualization, and scientific workflows.

🎥 I'm a founding member of **Astrotubers**, a Brazilian YouTube outreach project recognized by the **Brazilian Astronomical Society (SAB)**.
